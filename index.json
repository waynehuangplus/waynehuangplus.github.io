[{"title":"About","date":"","description":"Let's talk more stories about me. ","body":"Howdy, Welcome to my blog !!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I last wrote a blog, but now I plan to use here to record my daily life such as the food I cooked or where I visited, and finally the technologies I used on the job.\nCareer I started my career path as a DevOps for years, then I switch my role to Backend Engineer and Data Engineer later, especially in E-Commerce and IoT domains.\nAfter that, I joined many different startups, and help those companies to build product from zero to one. Before my last few year in startup company, I start to recruit my own team, define the technology roadmap of the whole company and focus more on business strategy and the market. I must say It\u0026rsquo;s interesting and a totally new experience to the one who was a software engineer.\nNow I am a Solutions Architect focusing on architecture design and help enterprise to solve the problems on the process of Digital Transformation.\nLife I really like to try new things in my daily life. From my getting my license on eighteen years old, I usually ride my scooter to visit different places and take photos. I think it\u0026rsquo;s way to relax yourself and sometime I would just sit by the sea and listen to the lap of the waves against the rocks. Few years ago, I decide to take another license, so that I can ride a motorcycle in Taiwan.\nBesides, everyone like delicious foods and I am no exception. So I usually cook some foods for me when I saw interesting or challenging recipes, and sometimes I also do the baking.\nTo me, I would life is important and the job is the way you make the money to let you enjoy the life.\n","ref":"/about/"},{"title":"My First Post","date":"","description":"","body":"","ref":"/blog/my-first-post/"},{"title":"Contact","date":"","description":"","body":"","ref":"/contact/"}]
