[{"title":"淺漬梅酒","date":"","description":"","body":"今年不知道看到了什麼，突然就想做個淺漬梅酒，為了泡酒，還特別研究了一下各種瓶子的差異，最後決定買了星硝(Seisho) 的玻璃提瓶，不過台灣都很貴，就直接從日亞下單了，加上運費還比台灣便宜一些。\n梅子的部份，今年聽說因為台灣沒什麼下雨，所以梅子也都特別小顆，單價上也比較高。在網路上找了一下，價格從 40 幾到 100 多塊都有看到。不過因為泡的量也不大，最後選擇了一間價格相對高 (95元/斤)，但是評價不錯的店買了 7 斤來泡酒。收到時是覺得品項還不錯啦，但貴是不是有貴的價值，只能等釀好才知道了。  Wines   這次用的酒有 Vodka、Whisky、Sake 以及 Gin。當中最貴的應該就那瓶 Roku Gin 了，一瓶 700ml 要價快 800 元。Roku Gin 跟另一瓶好市多最便宜的 Gin 相比之下，在香氣的確是不一樣，雖然還是可以聞到濃烈的酒精味，但可以喝得出來這瓶酒當初在釀的時候的確有花了一點功夫。官網上的介紹是這樣說的 ROKU在日文裡代表著「六」，六（ROKU）使用了6種經典的日本植物：櫻花、櫻花葉、日本柚子皮、煎茶、玉露，日本山椒。應該會是個純飲也很厲害的酒，只是被拿來釀梅酒就不知道會不會太浪費了。\n結果釀完 4.5 桶酒後，發現剩下的梅子好像還可以再釀個兩公升，最後又去附近的那種類似小北百貨的連鎖賣場扛了一瓶義大利制的玻璃瓶 (挑瓶子著實也花了點時間，因為架上大部分都是中國制的，會接觸到食物的東西感覺還是用好一點的比較安心) 來把這些傢伙通通變成梅酒 ！\n而每款梅酒瓶上的可愛酒標是由 Emily 特別設計的。\n飲酒過量，有害健康 ","ref":"/blog/2021/06/home-made-umeshu/"},{"title":"About","date":"","description":"Let's talk more stories about me. ","body":"Howdy, Welcome to my blog !!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I last wrote a blog, but now I plan to use here to record my daily life such as the food I cooked or places I visited, and finally the technologies I used on the job.\nCareer I started my career as a DevOps for years, then I switch my role to Backend Engineer and Data Engineer later, especially in E-Commerce and IoT domains.\nAfter that, I joined many different startups, and help those companies to build product from zero to one.

Few years ago, I got another motorcycle license that allows me make longer ride to the beautiful scenery in Taiwan and enjoy the speed (under speed limit of course).\nI really like to try new things in my daily life. From my getting my license on eighteen years old, I usually ride my scooter to visit different places and take photos.
